# TPK-5120---Elements-of-Model-Engineering
Involves the different models created for the course TPK 5120

Assignment 1 involves the fault tree and failure probability analysis of a simplified train brake system. Uses tool called Cassis to achieve this. The flow of code (.pbc files) could be opened with any text editor but actual running needs dedicated script which is not uploaded. More detail in the document "Question.pdf" under the directory.

Assignment 2 is a very broad work on different modelling formalisms learned during the course. Uses different tools like SHerlock, Cassis, Janos and Edsgar to solve the problems. The flow of code could be opened with any text editor but actual running needs dedicated script which is not uploaded. More detail in the document "Question.pdf" under the directory.
